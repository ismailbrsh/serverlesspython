# Messenger - backend

## VCS policy

1) Always branch out from the `development` branch unless it's a hot fix

2) Every commit message has to contain an issue's key (e.g. `MSG-2`)

3) Every functionality needs to be created as Pull Request, no direct commits to development are allowed

## Deploy

Run `sls deploy --stage dev` in order to deploy the application.
